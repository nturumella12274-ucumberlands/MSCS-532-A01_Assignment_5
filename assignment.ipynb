    "### Abstract\n",
    "This report explores the implementation and analysis of the Quicksort algorithm, focusing on both deterministic and randomized versions. We analyze their time complexities and compare their performance empirically across different input sizes and data distributions. The results indicate that randomization helps mitigate worst-case performance, offering a significant improvement over the deterministic version in certain scenarios.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "Quicksort is a widely used comparison-based sorting algorithm, renowned for its efficiency and simplicity. This report delves into the deterministic and randomized versions of Quicksort, exploring their time complexity, space complexity, and the impact of randomization on performance. Additionally, an empirical comparison is performed across different input sizes and distributions to validate theoretical expectations.\n",

    "#### Deterministic Quicksort\n",
    "The deterministic version of Quicksort follows the classical algorithm, where the pivot is chosen in a predefined manner (e.g., selecting the middle element). The algorithm works by partitioning the array into two subarrays and recursively sorting them.\n"

    "### Theoretical Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "- **Best Case**: The best-case time complexity of Quicksort occurs when the pivot splits the array into two nearly equal parts, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "- **Average Case**: On average, the pivot will split the array into reasonably equal parts, leading to an expected time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: The worst-case time complexity arises when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element, resulting in \\(O(n^2)\\). This scenario is common when the input array is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "The space complexity of Quicksort is \\(O(\\log n)\\) due to recursive function calls stored on the call stack. Additional memory is required for storing subarrays during partitioning, but it remains minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact of Randomization\n",
    "Randomizing the pivot selection significantly reduces the likelihood of encountering the worst-case scenario. By randomly choosing the pivot, we avoid the bias introduced by sorted or reverse-sorted inputs, thus ensuring a more balanced partitioning in most cases.\n",

    "The empirical analysis compares the deterministic and randomized versions of Quicksort across different input sizes and distributions. The performance is measured in terms of execution time for random, sorted, and reverse-sorted arrays of varying sizes."

However, randomization proves to be an effective strategy for avoiding the worst-case scenario, particularly in real-world applications where input distributions are unpredictable. The knowledge of both algorithmic approaches and their performance implications is essential for making informed decisions in algorithm selection and optimization."
